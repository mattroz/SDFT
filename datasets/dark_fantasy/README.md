# Dark Fantasy Image Caption Dataset

This dataset contains a collection of images and corresponding captions specifically curated for fine-tuning text-to-image model. The images in this dataset are from the dark fantasy genre.

## Dataset Details

- Number of Caption-Image pairs: 151
- Image resolution: 1024x1024

## Data Collection

The captions in this dataset were generated by the SDXL Base model quite casually, as this is a toy dataset intended for experimentation and exploration. The prompts were constructed by carefully selecting such prompts that would make the txt2img model generate old-styled fantasy images.

Specifically, one of the prompts was:
> `"Screenshot of a 1970's dark fantasy film, grimdark, ultra quality, 1970's art, dark fantasy, grained picture, grained, 1970’s dark fantasy book cover, paper art, dungeons and dragons style drawing, in the style of Zdzisław Beksiński and Darrell K. Sweet, vintage"`.

Please note that the captions themselves may not quite accurately describe the images. Feel free to fix this or generate your own.

## Dataset Format

The dataset is provided in a following format:
- `images/` directory;
- `metadata.jsonl` file;

Annotation file `metadata.jsonl` consists of JSON entries with the following structure:
```json
